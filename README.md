# LLM_Querying
Design and develop a Language Model based system that allows users to query reports/documents from ICAR - CRIDA website. For this purpose, either Fine Tune the LLM model with the given Agricultural data OR use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and populate it with this data. Start from a simple Prototype and incrementally add new features to the system e. g. begin with querying English documents followed by adding Hindi version.
